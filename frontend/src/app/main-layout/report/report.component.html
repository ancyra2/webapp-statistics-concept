                            The world’s energy system today is mainly powered by fossil fuels. The transition to a
                            low-carbon one will shift its underpinnings away from coal, oil, and gas to the minerals
                            needed
                            for solar, wind, nuclear, batteries, and other technologies. The dynamics of the energy
                            system
                            will shift dramatically.

                        <p>
                            Who currently produces critical minerals such as cobalt, lithium, nickel, and copper?
                            Which
                            countries have reserves that can be mined in the future?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These questions are crucial to deploying low-carbon energy at speed and scale and
                            managing
                            geopolitical and energy security risks along the way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The data is there to answer some of these questions. Institutions such as the US
                            Geological
                            Survey, the British Geological Survey, the International Energy Agency, and the Payne
                            Institute
                            publish it. But it’s still hard to get a quick overview of global production and
                            reserves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To help bridge this gap, we’ve published a data explorer on Minerals and Metals, where
                            you
                            can
                            dig into the numbers for a wide range of materials.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here, we wanted to give a more focused overview of some of the most essential minerals
                            to
                            the
                            energy transition. This is not an exhaustive list, but it should cover most of them in
                            one
                            place.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Note that this list is focused on minerals specific to the energy transition. Countries
                            and
                            regions will have their own lists of “critical minerals”. The European Union, for
                            example,
                            has a
                            different list of minerals it considers

                        <h1>A quick note on terminology</h1>
                        <p>The focus of this article will be on mineral production and reserves.</p>
                        <p>The first is mine production. As the name suggests, this is what’s directly mined out of
                            the
                            ground. This is often impure and mixed with other minerals or rocks. It usually needs to
                            be
                            refined to get it into a usable or final form.
                        </p>
                        <p>That’s the second form of production. Refined production is the conversion and separation
                            of
                            the
                            raw mineral into a pure or final form used in manufacturing. As we’ll see, the countries
                            that do
                            the mining are often different from those doing the refining.</p>
                        <p>The second key metric to focus on is reserves. Reserves tell us how much known and
                            assessed
                            mineral deposits can be mined economically with current technologies and market
                            conditions.
                            These are not to be confused with “resources”, which describes the total amount of
                            available
                            minerals. Reserves are resources that are economically viable today. We have a short
                            explainer
                            on this.</p>
                        <p>Both metrics — reserves and resources — can change over time as we find new deposits and
                            known
                            ones become more economical.</p>

                            Bauxite reserves show a very different geographical pattern. Guinea had the largest reserves
                            in 2023, followed by Vietnam (which is a very small producer of bauxite).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            China, the third largest producer of bauxite, has only a small amount of the world’s
                            reserves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
